# supercollider-UDP-theremin

A theremin that gets sensor data through UDP and synthesizes sounds on [supercollider](https://supercollider.github.io/). 

Currently tested with orientation data (pitch and roll) from an android device, using [SensorUDP](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ubccapstone.sensorUDP&hl=en_US&gl=US).

Initial synths adapted from [SCLOrkSynths](https://github.com/SCLOrkHub/SCLOrkSynths).
